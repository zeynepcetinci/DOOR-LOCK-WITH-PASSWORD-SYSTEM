# DOOR-LOCK-WITH-PASSWORD-SYSTEM
# DOOR LOCK WITH PASSWORD SYSTEM WITH ARDUÄ°NO LANGUAGE

In this project, I opened the door by entering a password using arduino materials. We enter the password using the keypad keys. 
If the password is wrong, it asks us to enter it again.
If the password is correct, the door opens and after 5 seconds the door closes.
You can see my project more clearly in the video in power point.
